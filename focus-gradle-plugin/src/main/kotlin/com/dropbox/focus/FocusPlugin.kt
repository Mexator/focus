/**
 * A Gradle plugin that generates module-specific `settings.gradle` files, allowing you to focus on a specific
 * feature or module without needing to sync the rest of your monorepo.
 *
 * It works by evaluating your project setup and creating a unique `settings.gradle` file for the module you want
 * to focus on, which only includes the dependencies required by that module. It then creates a `.focus` file that
 * references the currently focused module.
 *
 * With these files in place only the modules that you need will be configured by Gradle when you sync your project.
 * Deleting the `.focus` file, which can be done using the `clearFocus` task, will revert to using the includes file
 * to configure your entire project.
 *
 * This is optionally configurable vai the [focus][FocusExtension] extension.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * focus {
 *   // The name of the settings file that contains all of your standard `include` statements.
 *   allSettingsFileName = "settings-all.gradle" // Default
 *
 *   // The name of the file in your root project that identifies the generated settings file to use.
 *   // This should be added to your .gitignore file.
 *   focusFileName = ".focus"  // Default
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The general workflow is:
 *
 * 1. Focus on the module you'd like to work in by running it's `focus` task.
 * 2. Repeat step 1 as you work in other modules.
 * 3. Either delete the `.focus` file, or call the `clearFocus` task to stop focusing.
